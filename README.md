# map-your-addiction
[The human race collectively spends one billion hours each day on Youtube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/you-know-whats-cool-billion-hours/). It is in their favour to have you stay on their platform for as long as possible, and they achieve it by creating an algorithm that caters to you videos that will subconciously make you maximize your time on the platform. 

But from one mindless click after another, did you know what you actually watched, and how you spent your time? 

This project is a tool that maps out the content that you consume on Youtube in 2D, and clusters together similar videos so that it would be clear to see which types of videos you watch the most. It is created in the hopes of making people more concious about how they spent their time online.
